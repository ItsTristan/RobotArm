Authors: Falon Scheers, Tristan Meleshko

Compile the program in Eclipse with the LeJOS EV3 plugin. It is tested on version 8.1-beta.
No other special software considerations need to be made. The robot arm needs to be configured as follows:
  * Motor A to Motor B: 135 mm
  * Motor B to Motor C: 105 mm
  * Motor C to Effector: 85 mm

Motor A has z-axis pointing up, with a 2:1 gear reduction.
Motor B has z-axis pointing up, parallel to Motor A.
Motor C has z-axis pointing forward, centre is 85 mm above the ground.

When the program is run, a menu will be presented. Select an option using the up and down buttons,
and the middle button to select. Press back to quit.
To select points, press the touch sensor. It needs to be held for about a third of a second
to register. To end selecting points, press then middle button. You can also interrupt the program
at any time by pressing the Down and Middle buttons at the same time.

There is a JUnit file named TestKinematics.java which is used to test the math for the Kinematics.
